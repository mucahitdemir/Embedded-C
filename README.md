# Embedded-C
In this workspace, embedded C related examples were shared.
Embedded C is a set of language extensions for the C programming language by the C Standards Committee
to address commonality issues that exist between C extensions for different embedded systems.
Embedded C programming typically requires nonstandard extensions to the C language in order to
support enhanced microprocessor features such as fixed-point arithmetic, multiple distinct memory banks, and basic I/O operations.
